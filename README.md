dotfiles
========

My personal dotfiles directory.

Setup
-----

1. Run **setup_bash.sh**
2. Run **setup_zsh.sh**

This should result in a bunch of symlinks being setup in **$HOME**, in addition to installing various **zsh** packages and cloning the necessary **oh-my-zsh** git repo.

**Note:** It's also necessary to setup the terminal *Profile Preferences* such that the font is *Ubuntu Mono for Powerline*. This will allow the special characters used
          in the *oh-my-zsh* theme to be rendered properly.
